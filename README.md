# Maud – Data Skills Portfolio (Excel, SQL, Power BI)

This repository documents my **structured, hands-on journey** into data analysis using **Excel, SQL, and Power BI**. It is organized to clearly show **skill progression**, starting from foundational concepts and moving toward practical analysis and reporting.

The goal of this portfolio is not perfection, but **evidence of learning, logical thinking, and applied practice**. Each folder represents a stage in my development, with small, focused projects that build toward real-world analytical skills relevant across business, tax, and health-related contexts.

## How to Navigate This Repository
## Project Structure
Projects are organised by weeks to show clear learning progression:
##
| Level  | Projects                |
| ------ | ----------------------- |
| Week 1 | 1–3 small projects      |
| Week 2 | 2–4 medium projects     |
| Week 3 | 1–2 analytical projects |

* **Excel/** – Foundational to analytical-level projects, organized by learning stage (Week 1–3)
* **SQL/** – (In progress) Query logic and data reasoning, structured similarly for clarity
* **Power BI/** – (In progress) Visualization and reporting projects built on the same datasets

## Why This Repository
I created this repository to:
- Practice data analysis skills consistently
- Build a transparent learning portfolio
- Track my progress from beginner to more advanced levels

> **Suggested starting point:** Excel → Week3 (Analysis projects)

## What This Portfolio Demonstrates

* Clean data organization and structure
* Progressive skill development
* Ability to translate raw data into insights
* Readiness to grow into more advanced analytics and domain-specific work (e.g. health data)
  
This repository will continue to evolve as my skills deepen and my projects become more domain-focused.
